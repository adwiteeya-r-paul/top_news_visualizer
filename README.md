# Global-Top-News-Visualizer

This is an ongoing passion project that I built with an intention to submit in the Google Maps Platform Awards.
There are two versions I am working on: a website and an iOS app. The website has been deployed on render, available here: [https://top-news-visualizer.onrender.com/]

### What the project does

The project combines the power of `YouTube News` and "Google Maps" by collecting real-time data from Youtube Trending News from different parts of the world to create an interactive visualization of trending words in different countries of the world.

### Motivation behind this project

If `YouTube News` is combined with maps, we can perform interesting comparative analysis by observing news trending in different regions, be in the same area or in different continents. This is not only helpful because of the sheer entertainment found in visualizing trend differences based on geolocation even in today's global village, or the swift shift from election to celebrity gossip, but can also be used for journalistic purposes during important global events to display which countries' experiences are affected and which are not. 


### Skills to be acquired by this project 

As a young backend developer, I plan to use this project to build stronger backend and data processing skills upon my previous experiences (building a search engine and a dartmouth course planning chatbot, see links below), and also frontend skills from scratch. Examples would be:

1. adding API handling to my previous web-scraping skills 
2. strengthening my pandas/numpy skills to better parse and engineer huge amounts of data
3. working in basic Javascript to build an interactive map
4. using Swift to build an iOS App
5. improving my UX skills by following user-centric approaches
6. deploying for user testing in future
